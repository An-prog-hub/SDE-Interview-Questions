- Find the longest increasing subsequence of a given array of integers, A.

In other words, find a subsequence of array in which the subsequence’s elements are in strictly increasing order, and in which the subsequence is as long as possible.
This subsequence is not necessarily contiguous, or unique.
In this case, we only care about the length of the longest increasing subsequence.


Input Format:

The first and the only argument is an integer array A.
Output Format:

Return an integer representing the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
Constraints:

1 <= length(A) <= 2500
1 <= A[i] <= 2000
Example :

Input 1:
    A = [1, 2, 1, 5]

Output 1:
    3
    
Explanation 1:
    The sequence : [1, 2, 5]

Input 2:
    A = [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15]
    
Output 2:
    6

Explanation 2:
    The sequence : [0, 2, 6, 9, 13, 15] or [0, 4, 6, 9, 11, 15] or [0, 4, 6, 9, 13, 15]

-Given a grid of size m * n, lets assume you are starting at (1,1) and your goal is to reach (m,n). At any instance, if you are on (x,y), you can either go to (x, y + 1) or (x + 1, y).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

Example :
There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.

[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]

- A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:

 'A' -> 1
 'B' -> 2
 ...
 'Z' -> 26
Given an encoded message A containing digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it modulo 109 + 7.



Problem Constraints
1 <= |A| <= 105



Input Format
The first and the only argument is a string A.



Output Format
Return a single integer denoting the total number of ways to decode it modulo 109 + 7.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = "8"
Input 2:

 A = "12"


Example Output
Output 1:

 1
Output 2:

 2


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Given encoded message "8", it could be decoded as only "H" (8).
 The number of ways decoding "8" is 1.
Explanation 2:

 Given encoded message "12", it could be decoded as "AB" (1, 2) or "L" (12).
 The number of ways decoding "12" is 2.

- Say you have an array, A, for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

However, you may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Input Format:

The first and the only argument is an array of integer, A.
Output Format:

Return an integer, representing the maximum possible profit.
Constraints:

1 <= len(A) <= 1e5
1 <= A[i] <= 1e7
Example :

Input 1:
    A = [1, 2, 3]

Output 1:
    2

Explanation 1:
    => Buy a stock on day 0.
    => Sell the stock on day 1. (Profit +1)
    => Buy a stock on day 1.
    => Sell the stock on day 2. (Profit +1)
    
    Overall profit = 2

Input 2:
    A = [5, 2, 10]

Output 2:
    8

Explanation 2:
    => Buy a stock on day 1.
    => Sell the stock on on day 2. (Profit +8)
    
    Overall profit = 8

- Say you have an array, A, for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most 2 transactions.

Return the maximum possible profit.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).


Input Format:

The first and the only argument is an integer array, A.
Output Format:

Return an integer, representing the maximum possible profit.
Constraints:

1 <= length(A) <= 7e5
1 <= A[i] <= 1e7
Examples:

Input 1:
    A = [1, 2, 1, 2]

Output 1:
    2

Explanation 1: 
    Day 0 : Buy 
    Day 1 : Sell
    Day 2 : Buy
    Day 3 : Sell

Input 2:
    A = [7, 2, 4, 8, 7]

Output 2:
    6

Explanation 2:
    Day 1 : Buy
    Day 3 : Sell

- Implement wildcard pattern matching with support for ‘?’ and ‘*’ for strings A and B.

’?’ : Matches any single character.
‘*’ : Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

Input Format:

The first argument of input contains a string A.
The second argument of input contains a string B.
Output Format:

Return 0 or 1:
    => 0 : If the patterns do not match.
    => 1 : If the patterns match.
Constraints:

1 <= length(A), length(B) <= 9e4
Examples :

Input 1:
    A = "aa"
    B = "a"

Output 1:
    0

Input 2:
    A = "aa"
    B = "aa"

Output 2:
    1

Input 3:
    A = "aaa"
    B = "aa"

Output 3:
    0
    
Input 4:
    A = "aa"
    B = "*"

Output 4:
    1

Input 5:
    A = "aa"
    B = "a*"

Output 5:
    1

Input 6:
    A = "ab"
    B = "?*"

Output 6:
    1

Input 7:
    A = "aab"
    B = "c*a*b"

Output 7:
    0
